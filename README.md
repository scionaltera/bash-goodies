# bash-goodies #

A small collection of environment configuration files I use on many different machines and don't want to lose.

### How do I get set up? ###

For most of these, just copy them into your home directory with a dot in front of the names.

* bashrc - cp bashrc ~/.bashrc
* vimrc - cp vimrc ~/.vimrc

### Contribution guidelines ###

These are mostly personal, just for my own use, but if you find them useful please feel free to use them. If you spot bugs or want to improve on them, feel free to fork or submit a pull request.

These are mostly things I wrote, but they do incorporate bits and pieces from things I've found from browsing online. Originally I wasn't intending to make any of it public so I was bad and didn't properly attribute the parts I borrowed. If you spot your code in there and would like an attribution or you happen to know where something originally came from, I welcome pull requests to add proper attributions.

### Who do I talk to? ###

You can get in touch with me by sending a message through Bitbucket.
